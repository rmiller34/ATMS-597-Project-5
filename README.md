# ATMS-597-Project-5

Group C: KMSN (Madison, WI)

Group Members: Kevin Gray, Michael Sessa, Rose Miller

Objectives:

Train and test a logistic regression model to predict whether the precipitation is frozen or liquid (rain/snow)
Train and test a decision tree model to predict whether the precipitation is frozen or liquid (rain/snow)
Next, compare both of the models on their performance in relation to the climatology of the location in terms of the Brier skill score.

Data:

Data was downloaded from the ASOS FTP archive: : ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/asos-fivemin/.

This data was presented in five-minute intervals for many stations. The station data for this project is: KMSN.

Methods:

METAR data was processed and parsed using metpy to create a dataframe that can be read by pandas as a csv file. All unique values of current weather were viewed, and non-precipitation labels were replaced with NaNs and removed. Columns with substantial amounts of missing data were then removed, as well. From the remaining precipitation labels, a frozen precipitation and liquid precipitation grouping was created and then made binary.



Results:

Logistic Regression: 

Brier Skill Score=0.9398334216972509


Decision Tree: 


Brier Skill Score=0.9546344770308283
